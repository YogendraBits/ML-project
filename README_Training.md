Introduction
The project consists of two main parts: training the machine learning model and making predictions based on the trained model. The train_model.py script is responsible for training various classifiers using hyperparameter tuning, while the predict.py script loads the trained model and makes predictions on new data.

Dependencies
This project requires the following Python libraries:

scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
joblib
xgboost

You can install these dependencies using pip:

pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy joblib xgboost

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is stored in a CSV file named hotel_booking_data_extended.csv. This dataset contains various features related to hotel bookings, such as lead time, length of stay, weather conditions, and competitor pricing.

Features Engineering
Before training the model, some additional features are engineered based on the existing dataset. These features include:

Booking Flexibility Score: Calculated based on lead time, length of stay, and previous cancellations.

Booking Stability Indicator: Calculated based on lead time, length of stay, and room type.

Weather Impact Index: Incorporates temperature and precipitation level.

Competitive Pricing Gap: Difference between competitor price and total cost.


Model Training
The train_model.py script trains two types of classifiers: 
            Random Forest and XGBoost. 
Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV to find the optimal set 
of hyperparameters for each model. The best performing model is then saved for later use.

Model Evaluation
After training, the best performing model is evaluated using the test dataset. 
Classification report metrics are used to assess the model's performance, including precision,
recall, and F1-score for each class.

Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

Importing Libraries: The code starts by importing necessary libraries such as scikit-learn, 
pandas, numpy, and joblib. 
These libraries provide tools for data manipulation, machine learning modeling, and serialization.

Loading the Dataset: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file named hotel_booking_data_extended.csv 
using the pandas library. This dataset contains various features related to hotel bookings.

Feature Engineering: Additional features are engineered based on the existing dataset to 
potentially improve the model's performance. These features include:

Booking Flexibility Score: Calculated based on lead time, length of stay, and previous 
cancellations. It aims to capture the flexibility of booking arrangements.

Booking Stability Indicator: Calculated based on lead time, length of stay, and room type. 
It aims to measure the stability of booking arrangements.

Weather Impact Index: Incorporates temperature and precipitation level to capture the impact of 
weather conditions on bookings.

Competitive Pricing Gap: Represents the difference between competitor price and total cost, 
aiming to quantify the competitiveness of pricing.

Encoding Target Variable: The target variable, reservation_status, is encoded using LabelEncoder 
from scikit-learn. This step converts categorical labels into numerical values for modeling 
purposes.

Imputing Missing Values: Missing values in the dataset are imputed using SimpleImputer from 
scikit-learn. This step replaces missing values with the median of each feature to ensure 
completeness in the dataset.

Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning

Splitting Data: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split from 
scikit-learn. This step ensures that the model's performance is evaluated on unseen data.

Defining Models to Compare: Two types of classifiers, Random Forest and XGBoost, are defined for 
comparison. These models will be trained and evaluated to determine the best performing one.

Hyperparameter Grids: Hyperparameter grids are defined for each model type. These grids specify 
different combinations of hyperparameters to be explored during the hyperparameter tuning process.

Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearchCV: GridSearchCV from scikit-learn is used to perform 
hyperparameter tuning. It systematically searches for the best combination of hyperparameters 
within the specified grids using cross-validation.

Saving Best Model: The best performing model obtained from hyperparameter tuning is saved using 
joblib. This serialized model can be reused for making predictions on new data.


Model Evaluation
Feature Importance Analysis: After encoding, the feature importance of each model is analyzed. 
This analysis helps understand which features contribute the most to the model's predictions.

Model Evaluation on Test Data: The best performing model is evaluated on the test dataset using 
classification report metrics. This report provides insights into the model's performance, 
including precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
