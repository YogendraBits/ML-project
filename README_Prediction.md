                Hotel Booking Prediction System - predicting the output

This system facilitates predicting the reservation status of hotel bookings based on 
user-provided information. It utilizes a trained machine learning model to make predictions 
and provides an interface for user input.

Introduction
The system consists of two main components: 
loading the trained model and preprocessing components, and making predictions on user-provided 
data. The provided Python script, predict.py, serves as the interface for users to input 
information about a hotel booking and receive predictions about its reservation status.

Dependencies
This system requires the following Python libraries:

    pandas
    numpy
    joblib
You can install these dependencies using pip:

    pip install pandas numpy joblib


Usage


Loading Saved Model and Preprocessing Components: The script loads the trained machine learning 
model (hotel_booking_model.pkl), LabelEncoder object (label_encoder.pkl), and SimpleImputer 
object (imputer.pkl) using joblib's load() function. These components are essential for making 
predictions.

Getting User Input: The get_user_input() function prompts the user to input information related 
to a hotel booking, such as lead time, length of stay, previous cancellations, weather conditions,
room type, total cost, and competitor price. The input is collected and stored in a dictionary 
format.

Preprocessing User Input: The preprocess_input() function preprocesses the user input data 
before making predictions. It performs feature engineering, encodes categorical features, and 
imputes missing values to ensure that the input data is in the same format as the training data.

Making Predictions: The preprocessed input data is passed to the trained model to make 
predictions using the predict() function. The model predicts the reservation status of the hotel 
booking based on the input features.

Decoding Predictions: The predicted numerical labels are decoded back to their original 
categorical labels using the inverse_transform() method of the LabelEncoder. 
This step converts the numerical predictions back into human-readable categories.

Printing Predictions: The predicted reservation status is printed to the console, 
providing the user with the predicted outcome for the hotel booking based on the input provided.


Files Description

predict.py: Python script for making predictions on user-provided data.
hotel_booking_model.pkl: Serialized trained machine learning model for predicting reservation status.
label_encoder.pkl: Serialized LabelEncoder object for encoding and decoding categorical labels.
imputer.pkl: Serialized SimpleImputer object for imputing missing values in the input data.



Loading Saved Model and Preprocessing Components

Importing Libraries: The code imports necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, and 
joblib for loading saved model and preprocessing components.

Loading Saved Model, Label Encoder, and Imputer: The code loads the trained machine 
learning model (hotel_booking_model.pkl), LabelEncoder object (label_encoder.pkl), and SimpleImputer object (imputer.pkl) using joblib's load() function. These components are necessary for making predictions on new data.

Preprocessing User Input

Defining Preprocessing Function: A function named preprocess_input() is defined 
to preprocess user input data before making predictions. This function performs the 
same preprocessing steps as done during model training, including feature engineering, 
encoding categorical features, and imputing missing values.

Getting User Input: The function get_user_input() prompts the user to input information 
related to a hotel booking, such as lead time, length of stay, previous cancellations, 
weather conditions, room type, total cost, and competitor price. The input is collected and 
stored in a dictionary format.

Converting User Input to DataFrame: The user input collected as a dictionary is converted 
into a pandas DataFrame for further processing.

Preprocessing User Input: The preprocess_input() function is applied to the user input 
DataFrame to preprocess the input data before making predictions. This ensures that the input 
data is in the same format as the training data used to train the model.

Making Predictions: The preprocessed input data is passed to the trained model (model) to make 
predictions using the predict() function. The model predicts the reservation status of the hotel 
booking based on the input features.

Decoding Predictions: The predicted numerical labels are decoded back to their original 
categorical labels using the inverse_transform() method of the LabelEncoder (label_encoder). 
This step converts the numerical predictions back into human-readable categories.

Printing Predictions: The predicted reservation status is printed to the console, 
providing the user with the predicted outcome for the hotel booking based on the input provided.
